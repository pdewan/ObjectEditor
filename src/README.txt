ObjectEditor (also called UIGen) generates GUIs of Java Objects. It has been used in the UNC Comp 110 and Comp 401 courses.


The rule it uses are best described in the material linked from my comp 401 web site: http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/

The first version of the system was created by John Konglathu - its intent was to generate demo user interfaces for software developed by my research group.
I literally hacked this system to support teaching - by definition UI generation involves messy "heuristics" and the code reflects this.
The only reason I am putting this on GitHub is to allow some one  using ObjectEditor to step through its code when debugging their own programs or ObjectEditor itself.
I doubt anyone will be able to maintain this code, so I am not going to even bother trying to explain its structure.
